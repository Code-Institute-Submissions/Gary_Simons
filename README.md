# Gary Simons - personal resume website

---

## Overview

This is a website to **promote me as a Full Stack Web Developer**. In the future, I shall be able to use it to send to protential employers as a way of advertising my skills. It has been built using template inheritance which will make it easier to add content as my projects and skills grow. 

The aim of the project is to produce a website using **Flask** and **Python** that allows the use of data stored in a database on **MongoDB**. The website has to demostrate the data storage principles that you should be able to **create, read, update and delete (CRUD)** that data through a user interface. For my project, the user of that interface will be **me** as the website's owner. I have 'hidden' an admin section, which can be accessed from the footer on the **contact** page. This takes you to the **admin** page, from which you can read, add, update or delete the data. The data is diplayed to the users in a panel on the **about** page, using easy to diguest text and progress bars to show skills and skill levels attained. 

### The goals of this website are:
* To build brand awareness.
* To showcase my coding skills to potential employers and recruiters.
* To exibit my creative style to potential employers and recruiters.
* Intuitive navigation to keep the user engaged.

## Design choices

**The website is designed to reflect me as a creative full stack web developer** and show my style. The website is clean and stylish, using muted blocks of colour to define areas. 

### Colours
I created a **simple, complimentary, sophisticated colour scheme** that carries through the site. This enables the different pages to have their own feel and identity, while maintaining a holding colour theme that ties them all together, giving an upmarket feel.
* ```dark-grey: #4d4d4d```
* ```light-grey: #a6a6a6```
* ```dark-pink: #a34966```
* ```light-pink: #d996a9```
* ```dark-green: #5c9990```
* ```light-green: #bacfb2```
* ```dark-blue: #3c5682```
* ```light-blue: #688499```

### Fonts
I've used the san serif font **Montserrat** in two weights, (300 and 500) with some **sophisticated letter spacing** to add to the airy feel. I like the no-nonsense clean lines of the font, and feel it suits the website perfectly.

### Grid
I carried the same basic grid throught the pages to add contsiancy and easy of navigation. A lager **section header** quickly establishes the page you've landed on, and under that, is a panel holding the content for that page.

### Illustration
I created an image of a **woodcut style bird** carrying a card with the coding symbol **</>** on it. It is not only a beautiful image, but symbolizes me delivering coding solutions. I have used this image throughout the website and a visual logo of the website and of me.

## Wireframes

I built my wireframes using **Balsamiq Wireframes**. This was a quick and easy way to work out the basic pages and element and how the would interact with each other. Then mocked up more detailed versions using **Adobe InDesign** to allow me to play with fonts, colours and images. The basic stucture of my wireframes remained much the same, but colours and styling was adapted as I built the website and saw how it worked as a whole.

## Features

### Navigation bar
**This holds all the links to the sections of the site: Logo (home button), home, about, projects and contact.** This allows the user to navigate quickly to the relevant section. The Navigation bar is always visible when you are on the site, allowing for easy navigation to any part, no matter where you first land. The home button and logo will take you right back to the landing page where you can get your bearings and start your journey.

### Home
This is the first page a user comes to and it has to make a big impact. It has the job of informing the user as to what sort of site this is and to entice them to move further and engage with it. It opens with **strong simple white typography** on a plain grey background. Having a big name announces very quickly who the site is about. The tag line underneath then gives more context and explains what they do. **A beautiful illustration on a bird holding a card with </> on it symbolizes delevering code.** A tasteful about me link invites them to enter the site and takes the user straight to the **about** page where they can learn a bit more.

### About
**The about page shows some of the key information about me.** There is a brief introduction to me and the things I stand for. Below that are two panels. One showing **my skills** with an easy to understand progress bar showing my proficiency level in a graphic way. The other shows my **relevant education and qualifications.** Below them is a panel containing links to my **LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram** and a **downloadable pdf of my CV**.

### Projects
**The projects page highlighs some of the work I have been doing.** Each project is in a coloured panel with the website showing in a graphic line drawing of a laptop. A **view button** under each title opens a **large modal** with larger images of a laptop, tablet and phone. There is a short description of the site, a list of programs and languages used and a link to the **live website.** This gives the user an insite into the thinking behind the site and the way it was built. They can see how it displays on different devices, and then link to the website to see for themselves. I used two websites that I have built as **Milestone Projects** and made two **fake website homepages** to show how it would work with more.

### Contact
The contact page simply holds an **email for for users to fill in and contact me.** I kept the wording on the page very **inviting and conversational** to help the user feel more at ease and give a **friendly vibe.** At the bottom of this page is the footer, which again holds links to my **LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram** and a **downloadable pdf of my CV.** It has a copyright sign off and a link to the **'hidden' admin page.** 

### Admin
The admin page is the **interface with the MongoDB database.** It shows a panel showing the **stored data.** Beside each of the listings are two buttons, **edit** and **delete.** Below is a **add new skill** button. 

#### Edit
The **edit button** opend a new page where it shows the data that you've clicked on in a form that allows for them to be edited. Below are a save changes button with sends the updated data to MongoDB, and a **back to skills button** which takes you back to the list of skills on the **admin** page. 

#### Delete
The **delete button** on the page is actually a button that opens a **modal** that acts as a safety net. The message on the modal asks the question **'are you sure you want to delete this skill? once you press this button it's gone for good!'** There are then two buttons **'yes. i'm sure'** which is actually the **'real'** delete button that is wired up to remove the data. The other button **'no. keep it'** takes the user safely back to the **admin** page with no harm done.

#### Add
The **add skills button** opens a page with a form that needs to be filled in with a new skill and new proficiency level. The form has placeholder text to prompt the correct way to inpurt the data. There is a **add skill button** which adds that skill and level to the MongoDB database. Again there is a **back to skills button** which takes you back to the list of skills on the **admin** page. All the buttons on the site share common styles wit two different widths. All the changes made in these panels are reflected in the information on the **about** page.

### Favicon
The site has a **Favicon** to visually show the user where the site is in their open tabs. It uses the **GS logo** from the nav bar on the same grey background to tie it together.

## Features left to implement

* If time allowed I would have liked to add to the Admin page, to enable me to **build more projects.** I would build a template that would allow me to quickly and simply add as many as needed.
* It would be good to add a **blog page.** This would give another insight into my interests, skills and personality, and allow the users to be more engaged with me as a person.

## Testing
This was first time using **Python, Flask and MongoDB.** My testing was very thorough as each piece of code and app route had to work and link to the relevant part of the website. Being very conscious of how easy it was fo these elements to fail, I had to **test constantly** to make sure they performed how I wanted them to. The testing involved myself and that of my friends and family.

### Planning
The planning for this project involved using my wireframes to sketch a plan of which pages, buttons and forms needed to link to the database and to other parts. 

### Stories

* After deciding on a palette of colours for the website. It was felt I had too many and need to edit them down. I played around using a **Hex Colour Picker** website to find the colours that worked together as a family. Enough difference that they had their own identity, part similar enough to connect. I chose **four basic colours** and used a dark version and a light version.

* On my mock ups and during most of the build, I had my social links as just letters 'Li' (LinkedIn), 'Tw' (Twitter) etc. I felt they added a very stylish 'designer' look to the pages. But after several testers found them confusing and didn't immediately get what they were, I changed them to **FontAwesome** icons to make it clearer. I liked my letters, but the world wasn't ready for them.

### Overall

#### Responsiveness
* I wanted my website to be fully responsive and work and look perfect on all devices. 
* I used **Bootstrap** to build the basic grid of my website. This involved selection the best breakpoints to find the perfect balance on all devices. Reviewing the changes using the **Inspect** tools to get it right.
* The result was a very balanced and dynamic website that looked slick and stylish when adapting to different devices.

#### Design
* The design of the website needed to be clean, stylish and sophisticated. I had most of the elements and feel of the pages all worked out at the **wireframe** stage. Using the simple clean san serif font **Montserrat** in two weights, (300 and 500), and **opening up the letter spacing**, allowed me to create that feel. The **muted colours** all work together as a family to hold it together. 
* Using **CSS** styling allowed to create styles for images, words and panels that could be **replicated** accross the website. This also meant that it was easy to **change multiple elements quickly and simply.**
* The result is a website that have an elegant, upmarket design to allow users to see my creative side.

#### Projects page
* The projects page needed a way to showcase my work to the user. Originally I simply had each project in a panel with an image of the homepage on a laptop with some text underneath describing the website and a link to the live version. However. it was felt that this wasn't very dynamic. 
* To solve this, I created a **large modal** that pops up when the view button is clicked.
* This was a better solution as it allowed me to create a graphic showing the home page on laptop, tablet and mobile. It gave me more room to write the description and add the link to the live website.
* It is also better for **user experience** as it adds more interest and drama when it pops up. It also leaves the projects page cleaner and neater.

#### Delete button
* When I added the **delete** button to the admin page, it originally simply deleted any skill when clicked.
* It was felt that this was a very dangerous thing to do, as there was no going back once it was clicked.
* My solution was to wire up a modal that pops up when the **delete button** is clicked saying **'are you sure you want to delete this skill? once you press this button it's gone for good!'** There are then two buttons. **'yes. i'm sure'** which is actually the **'real'** delete button that is wired up to remove the data. The other button **'no. keep it'** takes the user safely back to the **admin** page.
* This solution means that the data is better protected from being deleted by accident, so makes it **more secure.**

### Bugs

#### Hamburger menu on mobile
* xxxxxx

#### Wiring up
* After I had built my basic pages, before I set up much of my CSS styling, I then set about wiring up each element in sequence before moving on to the next one. Having set up my **skills** database in **MongoDB**, my first challenge was to wire up my **About** page to show the data. 

#### Template Inheritance
* When first trying to work with Template Inheritance I built a **base.html** page with a code block to hold the html from the other pages. But when I ran my app.py file, I was getting an error telling that it couldn't find my template.

## Deployment

**My site is deployed on Heroku and GitHub.**

I've been using **GitPod**. These are the steps that I used in a **Unique Linux environment**. Please make sure you read your documentation to comply with your operating system.

1. First log onto **Heroku**.
2. In the **App Name form**, create a uniquie app name.
3. In the **Choose a Region** dropdown, choose **Europe** as that's our region and delivery will be quicker.
4. Click on **Create App**.
5. Next, log in to Heroku in the terminal with ```heroku login```. You will need to enter you email and password. This allows the connection from your project to Heroku and **allows us to push changes to Heroku using git**.
6. Create a new Git repository with the command, git innit.
7. Do a ```git add .``` to add the files and ```git commit -m "Intial commit"``` to commit those files.
8. We need now to associate Heroku as our remote master branch. Back on Heroku you will find the command ```heroku git:remote -a (name of your app)```, in the Deploy using Heroku Git section. Paste this into the terminal to set it up.
9. Create a **requirements.txt** file which will contain a list of all the applications required for Heroku to run the application.To do this type ```pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt``` in the terminal. This will create a txt file with the list in.
10. Add this file, commit it and push it to Heroku with ```git push heroku master```.
11. You now have to create a **Procfile** which will tell Heroku which file to call to get the application running. To do this, in the terminal write ```echo web: python app.py >Procfile```. Add this to GitHub, and commit. Then ```git push heroku master``` to save it to Heroku.
12. Next, we want to get our application running on Heroku. In the terminal, type ```heroku ps:scale web=1```. 
13. On Heroku, go to **'settings'**, and click on the **'Reveal Config Vars'** button. 
14. In here we need to supply a our IP address and our port. The first key is **'IP'** and it's value is **'0.0.0.0'**. The second key is **'PORT'** and it's value is **'5000'**. If you have hidden sensitive data such as your **MONGO_URI** in your **env.py** file, you must also put in the key of **MONGO_URI**, and the value of the **password code** from the env.py file. This is so Heroku can see it.
15. Click on the button **'Open app'** and it will start the app and show your page.
16. To make sure you push to Heroku automatically each time you push to GitHub, you can set it up in Heroku.
17. First click on **Deploy**, and click on **Deployment Method**. Then click on the **GitHub** selection.
18. Below that in click on **Connect to GitHub**, and enter your repository's name, and search for it. **Connect**.
19. Click on **Enable Automatic Deloys**, underneath that.
20. Finally, deploy it by clicking the **Deploy Branch** button.
21. Now every time you push to GitHub, it will automatically push it through to Heroku too.
